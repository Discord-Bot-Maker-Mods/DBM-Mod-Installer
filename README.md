# DBM-Mod-Installer
Simplifies installing Discord Bot Maker Mods.

Readme is currently being worked on! Here is the info from the first release xD

This tool is for windows 8.1+

Currently only DBM Mods BETA branch contains a modinfo.json manifest!
https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mods/tree/master

When more mod creators find out about the tool and add a modinfo.json then their mod will be able to be installed via the tool!

Remember, the mod that you're adding MUST contain a modinfo.json or the tool will deny adding it!

See https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mod-Installer/issues/2 for more information

languageTemplate.resx is the template to modify when submitting translations
github issue for translations: https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mod-Installer/issues/1

modinfo.json is the required file to have your mod work with the mod installer, its the manifest file to tell the mod installer what it is
